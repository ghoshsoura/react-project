This project is based on simple react concepts. Here I used the concept of react components, routers, navigations, reducers etc. to build an application which will help user to identify their geographical location. But first of all to understand what React is and how to create a react project, we need to understand some of the following informations - 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
React is declarative, efficient, and flexible. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".
When a component's state changes, React will efficiently update the DOM and only the parts of the UI that have changed. This makes your UIs fast and responsive.
React is also very flexible. You can use it to build any type of UI, from simple websites to complex web applications.
Here are some of the benefits of using React:
  Fast: React uses a virtual DOM, which makes it very fast at updating the UI.
  Flexible: React is very flexible and can be used to build any type of UI.
  Component-based: React uses components, which makes it easy to reuse code and build complex UIs.
  Large community: React has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources available to help you learn and use React.

So when the problem is about building an interactive user-interface, react is the first choice for many developers as it provides great flexibilty. But to understand react, we need to have a good understanding of the following - 
> What is HTML

> What is CSS

> What is DOM

> What is ES6

> What is Node.js

> What is npm

Now coming to the project, to create a react project we need some basic command prompts - 
# To create a React App: - 
## npx create-react-app [ProjectName]

> This will install several dependencies and modules and will take a few minutes to complete. Also it asks for additional components if you want to include in your project. After the process is completed, we should navigate to the project directory that is just created by normal cd command.

# To start a React App: - 
## npm start

> This will start an application running on localhost 3000(default). By default, the server side application page loads up and if you change your file logic, it will render accordingly.

# To install a Dependency: - 
## npm install [dependency name] or npm i [dependency name

>There may be case where we need some addtional dependencies for the project in order to execute the file. Then we can use 'npm' command to install dependencies. The above syntax will install all necesaary modules for that dependency and when finished installing, you can import relevant modules in your code.

# About Project: -
Now let's get to the point where I will discuss about how I implemented this project using all necessary react dependencies. First, of all after creating the project, I created a component folder under which i created some typescript files to implement the logic step by step.
